# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

## I chose App Services on Azure because,
- App Service is less likely to fail and has more availability (availability zones)
- App Service is easier to manage and faster to deploy
- App service has more support for legacy apps
- App Service is easier to scale in the long run in operations, cost, etc.
