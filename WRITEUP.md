# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

## I chose App Services on Azure because,
- App Service is less likely to fail and has more availability (availability zones)
- App Service is easier to manage and faster to deploy
- App service has more support for legacy apps
- App Service is easier to scale in the long run in operations, cost, etc.

## I avoided VM on Azure because,
- VM requires more configuration is less easier to manage and not as fast to deploy as App Services
- On VM there is less availability options, unless I plan on spending more money on availability zones
- Need to schedule maintenance when there is a software / OS upgrade
- Not easy scale in the long run in operations, cost, etc.
